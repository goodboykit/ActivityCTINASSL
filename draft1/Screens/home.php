                <br> It is characterised as having difficulties with language processing, such as difficulty reading aloud, inaccurate spelling and issues memorising sequences.

                Dyslexia affects a childâ€™s ability to decode and comprehend text, which makes learning challenging. This often leads to feelings of frustration and lower self-confidence in the classroom.
                At Literexia, we are committed to providing tailored tools and strategies to help children overcome these challenges, improve their reading fluency, and build lifelong skills for academic and personal success.
